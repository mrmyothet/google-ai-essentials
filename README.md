- few-shots prompting
- chain-of-thought prompting

### Harms and biases

- **Allocative harm:** Wrongdoing that occurs when an AI system’s use or behavior withholds opportunities, resources, or information in domains that affect a person’s well-being
- **Quality-of-service harm:** A circumstance in which AI tools do not perform as well for certain groups of people based on their identity
- **Representational harm:** An AI tool’s reinforcement of the subordination of social groups based on their identities
- **Social system harm:** Macro-level societal effects that amplify existing class, power, or privilege disparities, or cause physical harm, as a result of the development or use of AI tools
- **Interpersonal harm:** The use of technology to create a disadvantage to certain people that negatively affects their relationships with others or causes a loss of their sense of self and agency

### Framework for prompting

You’ll only get good output if you provide good input.
To help you create good input, consider using this framework when crafting prompts:

- Describe your **task**, specifying a persona and format preference.
- Include any **context** the generative AI tool might need to give you what you want.
- Add **references** the generative AI tool can use to inform its output.
- **Evaluate** the output to identify opportunities for improvement.
- **Iterate** on your initial prompt to attain those improvements.

### SHARE, the World Health Organization’s mnemonic

- **Source** your content from credible and official sources.
- **Headlines** don't always tell the full story, so read full articles before you share.
- **Analyze** the facts presented to determine everything you're reading is true.
- **Retouched** photos and videos might be present in the content you want to share, so be cautious about misleading imagery.
- **Errors** may be present in the content you're sharing and the information is more likely to be false if it’s riddled with typos and errors.
